<p>I am currently studying in the fourth year at IFSIC (http://www.diic.fr), an engineering school in Computer Science and Telecommunications (University of Rennes1 - FRANCE). My professional project is to work in Digital Image Processing, which is also my major. </p>
<p>Over the past four years, I have acquired good experience with computing languages like C++ and Java, which allowed me to become familiar with image computing. Considering the international dimension of this particular industry, I am really motivated to gain additional experience in a foreign country.</p>
<p>I develop a lot in ActionScript since it enables developers to quickly build light powerful applications; flash is a great tool to experiment user interface programms, dynamic sound generation, augmented reality and image computing.</p>
