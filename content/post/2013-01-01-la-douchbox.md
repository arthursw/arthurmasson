![The Show'Box](/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DouchBox.jpg)

The [Show'Box](http://www.lasophiste.com/portfolio/douchbox/) is a karaoke shower box. The idea is simple : one can sing confortably feeling alone under the shower, while being filmed and screened in the large room with the audience! Everything to exhibit in intimacy :-)

I developed the software which enable to select and play a video with subtitles, to overlay the singers on top of it, and to choose patterns for the background. Built with C++ and openframeworks.
