This installation is a complete programming interface for a light fresco. I made it with Quartz Composer so that other artists could easily modify the software.

In the end, the software was so complex that it is far from easy to understand it, so this technological choice was probably not the best, but it was a fun technical challenge.

I am pretty happy of the result which we presented at the Pim's, a night club in which I would have never gone otherwise.
